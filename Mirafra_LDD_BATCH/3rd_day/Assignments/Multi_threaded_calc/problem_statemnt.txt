Problem Statement: Multi-Threaded Calculator with File Logging
You need to create a multi-threaded C application using pthread where:

One thread accepts input (two numbers and an operation),

Another thread performs the calculation, and

A third thread writes the result into a file called results.txt.

✳️ Requirements:
Use POSIX threads (pthread_create, pthread_join).

Use shared memory (protected by pthread_mutex_t) or condition variables for synchronization.

Support basic operations: +, -, *, /.

✅ Expected Behavior
User inputs: 5 * 3

Input thread sends data to the calculation thread.

Calculator thread computes the result (15) and passes it to the writer thread.

Writer thread writes the string "5 * 3 = 15" to results.txt.
